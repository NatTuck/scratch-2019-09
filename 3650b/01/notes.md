 - Instruction Set Archetecture
   - Machine Instructions
 - Operating System
   - System Calls

Problem: Reading input from the keyboard.

 - Two programs at once, only one can have input.

Computer programming:

 * Writing a C program.
 
 * We still can't run the C program on our concrete computer.
 * First we need to compile it.
   - Compiler takes C => AMD64 Assembly.
 * Then assemble it.
   - Assembler takes AMD64 Assembly => AMD64 Machine code
