# CS3650: Hash Tables

## The problem: Building a Key-Value Map

 - Plan A: Association list.
   - Just make a list of {key, value} pairs.
   - Most operations are O(n)
 - Plan B: A Tree
   - Example: Balanced Binary Search Tree
   - Operations are O(log n)
 - Plan C: (the most common plan) Hash Tables
   - Operations are expected amortized O(1)
