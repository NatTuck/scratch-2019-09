## The Canvas Tag

 - Sometimes you don't want text and a heirarchy of rectangles.
 - Sometimes you don't want static images.
 - It's nice to have the ability to just draw arbitrary graphics.
 - We've got the Canvas API.
 - Canvas is based on the <canvas> tag + JS, and can run in two
   modes:
   - 2D: A vector drawing API similar to SVG files.
   - 3D: Called 'webgl2', lets us do hardware accelerated 3D graphics.
