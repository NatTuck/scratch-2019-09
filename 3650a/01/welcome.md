# CS3650 - Computer Systems

Instructor: Nat Tuck



A computer platform has:

 - Instruction Set Archetectures
 - An operating system

Modern desktops:

 - ISA is AMD64, x64, x86_64, Intel64

Modern cellphones:

 - ISA is ARM64

Our concrete platform for this semester is:

 - AMD64
 - Linux (Debian 10)

Operating systems provide a programming interface (API)
for access to shared resources. The "functions" in this
interface are called "system calls".

Writing computer programs:

 - You write computer programs in C.
 - You run C code through a C compiler: translates C code to
   native (AMD64) assembly code.
 - To get machine code, run the assembly through an assembler.
 - We want AMD64 machine code.
